# hello-world
New github project
Currently learning Java programming from a home study course. The course is from a company called "The Learning People".
Trying to do web development/design, so am also doing a little bit on HTML 5 and javascript along with basic CSS.
Also learning from Trevor Page's site and from www3 schools website.
I'm still a little unconfident about programming, so all help is appreciated. Eventually want to programme solo and be confident about it to the extent that it's second nature.
